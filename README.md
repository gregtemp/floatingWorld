This is a little max patch that lets you use your keyboard and trackpad as a midi controller on Mac OS. I'm still trying to figure out how to do it on windows. You can use the option key (click 5 times in a row) to turn off the track pad so you dont accidentally click stuff when you're performing.

This project relies on the fingerpinger.mxo (i think) and I just included it here, you can get it from the source here
